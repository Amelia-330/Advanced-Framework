Level 0

Explore： First，I Change 0 to 238 on the URL. After running, a reminder appeared: No... the 38 is a little bit above the 2...
我的第二次尝试是求取2的38次方的结果，将URL中的0用计算结果替换掉。
My second attempt was to take the result of 2 to the 38th power, and replace the 0 in the URL with the result of the calculation.
